## SOLUTION 1: "BURN THE LEGACY" 🔥
**Radical Replacement**

### Action:
- DELETE: cli.py, api_client.py, file_tools.py, utils.py, streaming.py
- PROMOTE: optimized_cli.py → cli.py
- UPDATE: setup.py entry point
- ADD: Missing streaming integration

### Pros:
- Clean slate, no legacy baggage
- Use superior implementation immediately
- Simple, fast, functional (your goals)
- Single source of truth

### Cons:
- Lose streaming functionality temporarily
- Risk breaking existing functionality
- No gradual migration path

## SOLUTION 2: "HYBRID EVOLUTION" ⚡
**Merge Best of Both Worlds**

### Action:
- KEEP: optimized_cli.py as core engine
- EXTRACT: streaming.py functionality into optimized version
- CONSOLIDATE: All utilities into single shared module
- DEPRECATE: Legacy files gradually
- UPDATE: Entry point to optimized version

### Pros:
- Preserve all current functionality
- Gradual transition possible
- Keep advanced features + streaming
- Minimal risk

### Cons:
- More complex migration
- Still some redundancy during transition

## SOLUTION 3: "MODULAR RECONSTRUCTION" 🏗️
**Clean Architecture with Separation of Concerns**

### Structure:
```
grok_cli/
├── __init__.py
├── main.py          # Entry point (simple)
├── core/
│   ├── cli_engine.py    # Main CLI logic (from optimized)
│   ├── api_client.py    # Unified API handling
│   └── config.py        # Configuration management
├── tools/
│   ├── file_ops.py      # File operations
│   ├── search.py        # Brave search
│   └── tool_manager.py  # Tool orchestration
├── utils/
│   ├── streaming.py     # Stream handling
│   ├── cache.py         # Caching logic
│   └── helpers.py       # Utilities
```

### Pros:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to test and maintain
- Scalable architecture
- Best practices

### Cons:
- More files (complexity?)
- Requires significant refactoring
- Might be over-engineering

## SOLUTION 4: "SINGLE FILE SUPREMACY" 📄
**Monolithic Simplicity**

### Action:
- COMBINE: Everything into one cli.py file
- INLINE: All functions and classes
- REMOVE: All import complexity
- RESULT: One file does everything

### Pros:
- Ultimate simplicity
- No import issues
- Easy to understand flow
- Fast execution

### Cons:
- Large file (maintainability)
- Harder to test individual components
- Goes against separation of concerns

## SOLUTION 5: "SMART CONSOLIDATION" 🎯
**Three-File Architecture**

### Structure:
```
grok_cli/
├── __init__.py
├── cli.py           # Entry point + main logic (enhanced)
├── engine.py        # Core functionality (API, tools, streaming)
└── utils.py         # Shared utilities (config, helpers)
```

### Action:
- MERGE: optimized_cli.py + streaming.py → engine.py
- ENHANCE: cli.py with optimized main() function
- CONSOLIDATE: All utilities → utils.py
- DELETE: Redundant files

### Pros:
- Clean, understandable structure
- Best features from both implementations
- Simple but not monolithic
- Easy to navigate

### Cons:
- Requires careful merging
- Need to ensure no functionality lost

## SOLUTION 6: "CONFIGURATION-DRIVEN" ⚙️
**Runtime Selection**

### Action:
- KEEP: Both implementations
- ADD: Settings flag to choose implementation
- ROUTE: Entry point based on config
- ALLOW: Users to pick version

### Pros:
- No breaking changes
- Users can choose optimization level
- A/B testing possible
- Safe fallback option

### Cons:
- Maintains redundancy
- Confusing for users
- More complexity in entry point
- Doesn't solve core problem

## SOLUTION 7: "INCREMENTAL OPTIMIZATION" 🔄
**Step-by-Step Enhancement**

### Phase 1: Fix Entry Point
- UPDATE: setup.py to use optimized_cli.py
- VERIFY: All functionality works

### Phase 2: Add Missing Features  
- INTEGRATE: streaming.py into optimized version
- TEST: All features work together

### Phase 3: Clean House
- DELETE: Legacy files (cli.py, api_client.py, etc.)
- CONSOLIDATE: Remaining utilities

### Pros:
- Low risk approach
- Can test at each step
- Gradual improvement
- Easy to rollback

### Cons:
- Takes longer
- Temporary inconsistency
- Multiple phases to manage
