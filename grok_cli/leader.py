   - Is this an isolated task or part of a larger system?
   - What dependencies exist?
   - What could go wrong?

2. THREE-PHASE BREAKDOWN:
   - Phase 1 (Investigation): What information do we need?
   - Phase 2 (Heavy Lifting): What is the core work?
   - Phase 3 (Polish): How do we ensure quality and completion?

3. DETAILED PLANNING:
   - Break each phase into specific milestones
   - Create meticulous ToDo task lists
   - Consider technical implementation details
   - Plan for testing and validation

2. Test basic functionality
### ToDo Tasks:
- [ ] Create or modify necessary files
- [ ] Implement required functionality
- [ ] Perform basic testing

## PHASE 3: POLISH & FINALIZATION
